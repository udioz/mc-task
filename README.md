# TODO
Error handling and logging
Validation
Terraform for AWS provisioning
Use env vars
DB connection pooling
Support more time ranges (not only last24)
Use ORM for accessing data models
Address pagination on collector external api call

# Scaling
Use a separate lambda for stdev calcs 

# Question:
Should I focus on one exchange or handle all?
Is SD calc is relative to market in same exchange or all?
I am not sure about naming conventions. var and func names. camel case or snake case?
What should be the rank of a 0 stdev
What is the tests coverage needed for the task considering I am not a python dev
